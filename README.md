# DETM modified to train on arxiv abstracts 

We modify the code to train on abstracts of papers from arxiv.org.

We try to match the settings from Dieng's paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05545), fix run time errors, add comments.

Other steps involving, from getting data, preprocessing, embedding words and results can be found here: https://github.com/quynhneo/detm-arxiv
